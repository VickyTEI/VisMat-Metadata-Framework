# Wellcome Collection Visual Material Metadata Framework

A developing metadata framework to ensure a common approach and content for records documenting Visual items in the collections.

The framework will define relevant metadata categories that reflect common museum practice and the needs of stakeholders.

The framework will inform cataloguing guidelines for the library and archival systems which host the data at Wellcome Collection.
