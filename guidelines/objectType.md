## Object Type

*CCO: The Object type element provide fundamental ways to refer to a work. Determining how to refer to a work is part of the first critical decision in the cataloguing process.*

It identifies the kind of work or works being described. Object Type typically refers to a workâ€™s physical form, function, or medium. 
For our cataloguing purposes we will consider Object Type to refer to physical form and/or function. The medium/technique will be recorded in a different field.

To ensure consistency, Object Type terminology should be controlled and taken from a list or thesaurus. Our list of object Type terms is created in-house based on the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.

If the object cannot be described by any of the existent terms, the cataloguer is required to liaise with the Wellcome cataloguing team with reference to above thesauri if possible for the term to be added to the controlled vocabulary.

It is possible to select multiple terms for the same object or group of objects. However, it is suggested to maintain the use of broader terms, as more information about the object will be given at different levels in the catalogue record.
