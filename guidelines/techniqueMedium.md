## Technique and Medium

*CCO: Recording Materials and Techniques is required. Specify the matter, materials or substances used to create a work and the processes, and implements used to apply or form the material, as appropriate.*

To ensure consistency, Object Materials and Techniques terminology should be controlled and taken from a list or thesaurus. Our list of object Type terms is created in-house based on the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.

If the object cannot be described by any of the existent terms, the cataloguer is required to liaise with the Wellcome cataloguing team with reference to above thesauri if possible for the term to be added to the controlled vocabulary.

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects if known but the broadest possible term should be used if there is uncertainty.
