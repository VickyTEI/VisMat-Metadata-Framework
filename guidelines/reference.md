## Reference Number

A unique ID number must be allocated to every object to enable identification of an object or group of objects. The number must be attached to the object or it’s container.

The unique numbers follow Wellcome conventions for Visual Materials or Archives. Wellcome Collection doesn’t currently have the capability for a single sequence of ID numbers.

The record should aim to include all previous ID numbers associated with the object: Accession numbers, Inventory numbers, obsolete / historical reference numbers.

Part numbers should only be applied to identical objects.
