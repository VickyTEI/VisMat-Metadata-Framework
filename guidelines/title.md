## Title

### CCO Guidelines:
The Title element records the titles, identifying phrases, or names given to a work of art or architecture. It may be used for various kinds of titles or names. Titles may be descriptive phrases that refer to the iconographical subject or theme of the art work. They may also record the identifying phrases or names given to works that do not have a title per se. 
Titles may come from various sources. Titles for works are typically assigned by artists, owning institutions, collectors, or scholars. Titles for well-known works commonly become authoritative through publications and scholarship (for example, Mona Lisa). 
Many works, including utilitarian works, decorative art, cultural artifacts, maps, diagrams, archaeological works, ethnographic materials, and some buildings, do not have titles or names per se. For these works, a descriptive title should be constructed to facilitate identification by users. A visual resources collection may have to construct titles when there is no repository-supplied title for a work. Construct titles when necessary. Titles may be derived from their subject content or iconography.
All significant titles or names by which a work is or has been known should be recorded. Works of art or architecture may be known by many different titles or names; titles may change throughout history. It is useful for researchers to know the alternate and former titles, names, or identifying phrases for the work. Title Type Including a Title Type provides a way to distinguish between the various types of titles (for example, repository title, inscribed title, creatorâ€™s title, descriptive title)
